## Problem Statement
The alarming rise in workplace stress affects a significant number of office-going staff, with studies reporting that approximately 80% of employees experience stress-related symptoms. This chronic stress not only impacts their mental health but also results in decreased productivity, higher absenteeism rates, and increased healthcare costs. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an innovative solution that can effectively detect and manage stress, improving the overall well-being and performance of individuals in the workplace.

Wearable Band: Our solution utilizes a comfortable and user-friendly wearable band equipped with EEG sensors to capture brainwave signals related to stress.
Comfort is a priority. Our device is lightweight, ergonomically designed, and easy to adjust. It's designed to be unobtrusive so users can wear it comfortably throughout the day, whether they're at work, home, or on the go.
The device is equipped with specialized electrodes placed on the forehead. These electrodes capture brainwave signals, which are essentially the electrical activity generated by neural cells. This non-invasive approach ensures accurate stress monitoring without any discomfort .to the user.
The device continually collects brainwave data, sending it in real-time to our cloud-based platform for analysis. This live data stream forms the foundation of our stress monitoring system.
Our mobile app complements the wearable device, providing users with real-time stress information, analysis, and actionable insights.
Based on this analysis, the app offers personalized stress management recommendations. These recommendations encompass various techniques, from breathing exercises and meditation prompts to mindfulness practices. This tailored approach equips users with practical tools to effectively manage stress.
Software Analysis:
The collected brainwave data is fed into our powerful software analysis system. This software plays a crucial role in interpreting the data and providing valuable insights into stress levels.

Data Processing:
Our software utilizes advanced algorithms to process the incoming brainwave signals. These algorithms clean, preprocess, and transform the raw data into usable patterns, preparing it for stress analysis.
Machine Learning Models:
The heart of our stress level determination lies in the application of machine learning models. These models are trained on extensive datasets, learning to recognize patterns in brainwave data that correlate with stress levels.

Stress Level Prediction:
Once the models are trained, they are deployed to predict stress levels based on real-time EEG data. The software assesses the processed brainwave patterns and, through machine learning, assigns a stress level estimation to the user.
